Product tests:

Pros:
   - Custom equals method
   - Separate constructor with product id

Cons:
  -  Constructor (it contained logic that made creating product impossible when
    ProductCategory or Supplier were null)
   - setDefaultPrice - this method didn't contain validation of provided price, therefore
    it was possible to enter negative value
   - setPrice - this method didn't contain validation of provided price, therefore
    it was possible to enter negative value


Cart tests:
Pros:
    - clever add product method;
    - good code structure;

Cons:
    - changeQuantity method enabled change of quantity below 0;
    - getIndexIfExists - one private one public method may be a bit misleading;

ProductDaoSqlite - no remarks. All tests passed.

ProductController - no remarks. All tests passed.
